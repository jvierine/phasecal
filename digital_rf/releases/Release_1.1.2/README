OVERVIEW

This library allows the writing and reading of RF data in an Hdf5 standard format.  It is designed for RF
data archive, and to allow rapid random access.  Written by Bill Rideout (brideout@haystack.mit.edu), in 
collaboration with Juha Vierinan (x@haystack.mit.edu) and Frank Lind (flind@haystack.mit.edu)

See documents/Digital_RF.pdf for details

PREREQUISTES

The Hdf5 library (1.8 or greater) is required before installation.  See http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/
for more information.


C INSTALLATION


Do the normal ./configure, make, make install procedure.  Run "make check" to compile the test programs
test_rf_write_hdf5 and benchmark_rf_write_hdf5 in the testing directory, where you should be able to simply
run them without arguments. They will create test files in /tmp/hdf5*.  To clean up, run:

rm -r /tmp/hdf5*


PYTHON INSTALLATION


Do the normal 

python setup.py install

to install.  For test, cd testing (must be run from this directory) and run 

python test_digital_rf.hdf5.py

This will create test files in /tmp/hdf5*.  To clean up, run:

rm -r /tmp/hdf5*
