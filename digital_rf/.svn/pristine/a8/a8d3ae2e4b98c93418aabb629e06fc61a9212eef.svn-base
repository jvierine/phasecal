	Release 1.1.1  - Aug 4, 2014

Release 1.1.1 differs from Release 1.1 in that the python read methods were changed.  The method read_vector
now returns all data in format numpy.complex8, no matter how the data was stored in the underlying Hdf5 file.
A new method, read_vector_raw duplicates the old read_vector method, returning data in the format stored in 
the Hdf5 raw files.  The method read_vector_c81d that returns data as a single subchannel in numpy.complex8
format still exists, but issues a UserWarning recommending use of the other methods.

	Release 1.1 - July 7, 2014

Release 1.1 differs from Release 1.0 in that the directory naming convention was changed from HH:MM:SS since certain
file systems disallowed colons in directory names.  This affected both the read and write API's.

	Release 1.0 - May 29, 2014
	
Release 1.0 is the first major release of the C and Python API's supporting the Digital RF HDF5 raw data format.
